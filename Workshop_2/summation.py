# Workshop 2 activity #1: Create a summation function! This function will take
# a list as an input, and will return the sum of all items in that list as an
# output. Your code should resemble the following pseudocode:
# |
# |  define a function called summation, which takes in 1 input called sequence.
# |
# |      let total = 0
# |
# |      for every item in the sequence:
# |          add the item to the total
# |
# |      return the total
# |
# The first line of code is already done for you.

def summation(sequence):
